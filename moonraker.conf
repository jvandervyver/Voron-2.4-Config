queue_gcode_uploads: False

#   When set to True gcode files will be run through a "preprocessor"
#   during metadata extraction if object tags are detected.  This preprocessor
#   replaces object tags with G-Code commands compatible with Klipper's

[data_store]
#   The maximum number of temperature values to store for each sensor. Note

# this enables moonraker's update manager
[update_manager]
#   When set to True moonraker will bypass repo validation and allow
#   updates from unofficial remotes and/or branches.  Updates on
#   detached repos are also allowed.  This option is intended for
#   developers and should not be used on production machines.  The
#   default is False.
enable_repo_debug: True

#   A boolean value that can be used to toggle system package updates.
#   Currently Moonraker only supports updating packages via APT, so
#   this option is useful for users that wish to experiment with linux
#   distros that use other package management applications, or users
#   that prefer to manage their packages directly.  Note that if this
#   is set to False users will be need to make sure that all system
#   dependencies are up to date.  The default is True.
enable_system_updates: True

#   When set to True Moonraker will attempt to fetch status about
#   available updates roughly every 24 hours, between 12am-4am.
#   When set to False Moonraker will only fetch update state on startup
#   and clients will need to request that Moonraker updates state.  The
#   default is False.
enable_auto_refresh: true

#   The interval (in hours) after which the update manager will check
#   for new updates.  This interval is applies to updates for Moonraker,
#   Klipper, and System Packages, and is the default for all clients.
#   The default is 672 hours (28 days).
