[resonance_tester]

#   A name of the accelerometer chip to use for measurements. If
#   adxl345 chip was defined without an explicit name, this parameter
#   can simply reference it as "accel_chip: adxl345", otherwise an
#   explicit name must be supplied as well, e.g. "accel_chip: adxl345
#   my_chip_name". Either this, or the next two parameters must be
#   set.
accel_chip: adxl345

#   A list of X, Y, Z coordinates of points (one point per line) to test
#   resonances at. At least one point is required. Make sure that all
#   points with some safety margin in XY plane (~a few centimeters)
#   are reachable by the toolhead.
probe_points: 175,175,20

#   Maximum input shaper smoothing to allow for each axis during shaper
#   auto-calibration (with 'SHAPER_CALIBRATE' command). By default no
#   maximum smoothing is specified. Refer to Measuring_Resonances guide
#   for more details on using this feature.
#max_smoothing:

#   Minimum frequency to test for resonances. The default is 5 Hz.
min_freq: 5

#   Maximum frequency to test for resonances. The default is 133.33 Hz.
max_freq: 133.33

#   This parameter is used to determine which acceleration to use to
#   test a specific frequency: accel = accel_per_hz * freq. Higher the
#   value, the higher is the energy of the oscillations. Can be set to
#   a lower than the default value if the resonances get too strong on
#   the printer. However, lower values make measurements of
#   high-frequency resonances less precise. The default value is 75
#   (mm/sec).
accel_per_hz: 75

#   Determines the speed of the test. When testing all frequencies in
#   range [min_freq, max_freq], each second the frequency increases by
#   hz_per_sec. Small values make the test slow, and the large values
#   will decrease the precision of the test. The default value is 1.0
#   (Hz/sec == sec^-2).
hz_per_sec: 1

[adxl345]
#   If the micro-controller supports multiple SPI busses then one may
#   specify the micro-controller bus name here. The default depends on
#   the type of micro-controller.
#spi_bus:

#   The SPI enable pin for the sensor
cs_pin: rpi:None

#   The SPI speed (in hz) to use when communicating with the chip.
#   The default is 5000000.
spi_speed: 5000000

#   Output data rate for ADXL345. ADXL345 supports the following data
#   rates: 3200, 1600, 800, 400, 200, 100, 50, and 25. Note that it is
#   not recommended to change this rate from the default 3200, and
#   rates below 800 will considerably affect the quality of resonance
#   measurements.
rate: 3200

#   The accelerometer axis for each of the printer's X, Y, and Z axes.
#   This may be useful if the accelerometer is mounted in an
#   orientation that does not match the printer orientation. For
#   example, one could set this to "y, x, z" to swap the X and Y axes.
#   It is also possible to negate an axis if the accelerometer
#   direction is reversed (eg, "x, z, -y"). The default is "x, y, z".
axes_map: x,y,z
