#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) of the nozzle, clicking on the Z endstop.
nozzle_xy_position: 231,350

#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) of the probe's switch body, clicking on
#   the Z endstop.
# body: 225.8,331
# switch 231.7, 331
switch_xy_position: 231.7,331

#   a X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) where the print surface (e.g. the center
#   point) is probed. These coordinates will be adapted by the
#   probe's X and Y offsets. The default is the relative_reference_index
#   of the configured bed_mesh, if configured. It's possible to change the relative
#   reference index at runtime or use the GCode argument BED_POSITION of CALIBRATE_Z.
bed_xy_position: 175,175

#   The trigger point offset of the used mag-probe switch.
#   Larger values will position the nozzle closer to the bed.
#   This needs to be find out manually. More on this later
#   in this section..
switch_offset: 0.327

#   The maximum allowed deviation of the calculated offset.
#   If the offset exceeds this value, it will stop!
#   The default is 1.0 mm.
max_deviation: 2

#   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values
#   will be averaged. The default is from the probe's configuration.
samples: 4

#   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
#   samples. The default is from the probe's configuration.
samples_tolerance: 0.0025

#   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
#   samples_tolerance. The default is from the probe's configuration.
samples_tolerance_retries: 10

#   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
#   "median" or "average". The default is from the probe's configuration.
samples_result: median

#   The distance in mm to move up before moving to the next
#   position. The default is two times the z_offset from the probe's
#   configuration.
clearance: 15

#   Minimum valid distance (in mm) used for probing move. The
#   default is from the Z rail configuration.
#position_min: default from "stepper_z:position_min" section.

#   The moving speed in X and Y. The default is 50 mm/s.
speed: 300

#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
#   samples and clearance moves. The default is from the probe's
#   configuration.
#lift_speed: default from "probe:lift_speed" section

#   The fast probing speed (in mm/s) used, when probing_first_fast
#   is activated. The default is from the Z rail configuration.
#probing_speed: default from "stepper_z:homing_speed" section.

#   The slower speed (in mm/s) for probing the recorded samples.
#   The default is second_homing_speed of the Z rail configuration.
#probing_second_speed: default from "stepper_z:second_homing_speed" section.

#   Distance to retract (in mm) before probing the next sample.
#   The default is homing_retract_dist from the Z rail configuration.
#probing_retract_dist: default from "stepper_z:homing_retract_dist" section.

#   If true, the first probing is done faster by the probing speed.
#   This is to get faster down and the result is not recorded as a
#   probing sample. The default is false.
probing_first_fast: True
